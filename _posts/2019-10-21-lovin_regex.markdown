HI Everyone!

My name is Michael Carroll. I recently enrolled in the Self Paceed Flatiron Software Online Engineering Programming.  These past couple weeks have been an awesome experience and continue to help me build confidence in my skills.  My learning in the Regex Labs has enabled me write a shell script to rename all my files in a local directory with  just a couple lines of code.  I later learned through some web searching the Regex script I made could have been done in the command line with 1 line of code. Love being apply these lessons from Flatiron to the my work! Excited to keep on grinding and learning!
